# Pull request guidelines

[GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) are a great way for everyone in the community to contribute to the Laravel codebase. Found a bug? Just fix it in your fork and submit a pull request. This will then be reviewed, and, if found as good, merged into the main repository.

- **Branch:** Unless they are immediate documentation fixes relevant for old versions, pull requests should be sent to the `develop` branch only. Make sure to select that branch as target when creating the pull request (GitHub will not automatically select it.)
